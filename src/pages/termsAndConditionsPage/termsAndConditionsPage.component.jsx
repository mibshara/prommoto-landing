        <h1>Terms and conditions</h1>
        <p>
          These terms and conditions ("Agreement") set forth the general terms
          and conditions of your use of the "Prommoto - Vehicle Advertising"
          mobile application ("Mobile Application" or "Service") and any of its
          related products and services (collectively, "Services"). This
          Agreement is legally binding between you ("User", "you" or "your") and
          Prommoto International Inc. (doing business as "Prommoto", "we", "us"
          or "our"). If you are entering into this agreement on behalf of a
          business or other legal entity, you represent that you have the
          authority to bind such entity to this agreement, in which case the
          terms "User", "you" or "your" shall refer to such entity. If you do
          not have such authority, or if you do not agree with the terms of this
          agreement, you must not accept this agreement and may not access and
          use the Mobile Application and Services. By accessing and using the
          Mobile Application and Services, you acknowledge that you have read,
          understood, and agree to be bound by the terms of this Agreement. You
          acknowledge that this Agreement is a contract between you and
          Prommoto, even though it is electronic and is not physically signed by
          you, and it governs your use of the Mobile Application and Services.
        </p>
        <h2>Accounts and membership</h2>
        <p>
          If you create an account in the Mobile Application, you are
          responsible for maintaining the security of your account and you are
          fully responsible for all activities that occur under the account and
          any other actions taken in connection with it. We may monitor and
          review new accounts before you may sign in and start using the
          Services. Providing false contact information of any kind may result
          in the termination of your account. You must immediately notify us of
          any unauthorized uses of your account or any other breaches of
          security. We will not be liable for any acts or omissions by you,
          including any damages of any kind incurred as a result of such acts or
          omissions. We may suspend, disable, or delete your account (or any
          part thereof) if we determine that you have violated any provision of
          this Agreement or that your conduct or content would tend to damage
          our reputation and goodwill. If we delete your account for the
          foregoing reasons, you may not re-register for our Services. We may
          block your email address and Internet protocol address to prevent
          further registration.
        </p>
        <h2>Links to other resources</h2>
        <p>
          Although the Mobile Application and Services may link to other
          resources (such as websites, mobile applications, etc.), we are not,
          directly or indirectly, implying any approval, association,
          sponsorship, endorsement, or affiliation with any linked resource,
          unless specifically stated herein. Some of the links in the Mobile
          Application may be "affiliate links". This means if you click on the
          link and purchase an item, Prommoto will receive an affiliate
          commission. We are not responsible for examining or evaluating, and we
          do not warrant the offerings of, any businesses or individuals or the
          content of their resources. We do not assume any responsibility or
          liability for the actions, products, services, and content of any
          other third parties. You should carefully review the legal statements
          and other conditions of use of any resource which you access through a
          link in the Mobile Application. Your linking to any other off-site
          resources is at your own risk.

        <p>
          "Intellectual Property Rights" means all present and future rights
          conferred by statute, common law or equity in or in relation to any
          copyright and related rights, trademarks, designs, patents,
          inventions, goodwill and the right to sue for passing off, rights to
          inventions, rights to use, and all other intellectual property rights,

          applications and rights to apply for and be granted, rights to claim
          priority from, such rights and all similar or equivalent rights or
          forms of protection and any other results of intellectual activity
          which subsist or will subsist now or in the future in any part of the
          world. This Agreement does not transfer to you any intellectual
          property owned by Prommoto or third parties, and all rights, titles,
          and interests in and to such property will remain (as between the
          parties) solely with Prommoto. All trademarks, service marks, graphics
          and logos used in connection with the Mobile Application and Services,
          are trademarks or registered trademarks of Prommoto or its licensors.
          Other trademarks, service marks, graphics and logos used in connection
          with the Mobile Application and Services may be the trademarks of
          other third parties. Your use of the Mobile Application and Services
          grants you no right or license to reproduce or otherwise use any of

          liability. The limitations and exclusions also apply if this remedy
          does not fully compensate you for any losses or fails of its essential
          purpose.
